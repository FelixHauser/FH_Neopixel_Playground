# FH_Neopixel_Playground
 Felix's Neopixel Playground

## What's that?

  Just my playground to experiment with Neopixels

## Libraries used

  * FastLED: https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED  (Available through the Arduino Library Manager)
  * RotaryEncoder: https://github.com/mathertel/RotaryEncoder and http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino (Available through the Arduino Library Manager)
  * Bounce: http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/Bounce   (I used the first version as it's the one already installed on my system)

## What can it do?

  * 24.01.2020 Using a Rotary Encoder, the LEDs light up on one direction and switch themselves off on the opposite direction.
  * 25.01.2020 Added the push button functionality of the encoder with the internal pull-up resistor. Bounce library is required for debouncing. It changes LED colors when pushed.
